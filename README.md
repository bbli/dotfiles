# Dotfiles

In an effort to reach even greater heights in vim, I have invented a theory for assigning mappings
* **F1-10 Keys**: Toggles(NERDTREE, spellcheck)
* **Semi-Colon**: Short command mode stuff in which I don't need to see the input(:w)
* **Meta**: Repeated actions(moving lines, macros)
* **Leader(Space)**: Files, Text Manipulation and Vim External Interactions(FZF,system clipboard)
* **Local Leader(-)**: Non-Vim External Interactions(Vimux,markdown preview)
