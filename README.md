# Dotfiles

In an effort to become a hotkey spammer like Emacs users/become better at vim, I have created the following guideline for assigning hotkeys.
* **Leader(Space)**: Default memomic maps. Most of my key bindings are here
* **Semi-Colon**: Short command mode stuff in which I don't need to see the input(:w)
* **Leader Leader**: changes to files that conflict with memomic maps(commenting,formatting)

* **Local Leader(-)**: External Interactions(markdown preview,edit config files)

## Things to do on Server
* Install conda environment
* Install neovim appimage
* copy ipython kernel specs

* **If git version is too old -> just rsync over my plugin repo directory**
