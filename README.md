# Dotfiles

In an effort to become a hotkey spammer like Emacs users/become better at vim, I have created the following guideline for assigning hotkeys.
* **F1-10 Keys**: Toggles(NERDTREE, spellcheck)
* **Semi-Colon**: Short command mode stuff in which I don't need to see the input(:w)
* **Meta**: Repeated actions(moving lines, macros)
* **Leader(Space)**: Files, Text Manipulation and Vim External Interactions(FZF,system clipboard)
* **Local Leader(-)**: Non-Vim External Interactions(Vimux,markdown preview)

## Things to do on Server
* Install conda environment
* Install neovim appimage
* copy ipython kernel specs

* **If git version is too old -> just rsync over my plugin repo directory**
